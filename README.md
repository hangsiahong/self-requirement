## What are you reading?
This is about my life journey to become a better father and a better problem solver.

There are alots of people all around the world. They are full of creativity, talented, hard-worked, bullshited. Everybody often lost track of what they wanted in life. They forget why they start and they forget what is the purpose of their life. In order for me not to forget what i want the most in life,
I will be writing everything down so i can read everyday, reminding myself.

## What do i pursue, my goal, my conviction, will i really be satisfied if i have it?
What i really want in life is to have a small family, living with my soulmate and raise a couple of children of my own. That what really
matter to me the most and every thing else is just a stepping stone
for me to overcome and to achieve the my own goal. That will be my first goal in life.

In order to be achieve my first goal, i already set my mind up to go on a journey to
overcome myself and strive to be the best version of me.
